# Fraud-Detection-Deep_Learning-Project
This project involves Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions, showing how we can automatically identify fraudulent transactions in mobile money systems through: 
- Supervised tabular models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest , XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Unsupervised models (AE / VAE)
- Graph Neural Network (GraphSAGE)
